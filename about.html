                            <p>Nice to meet you, I'm Pedro Conde. I'm a <span class="highlight">New Media</span> student with a passion for all forms of design, from <span class="highlight">graphic</span> and <span class="highlight">web</span> to <span class="highlight">UX/UI</span>.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm driven by the desire to create meaningful <span class="highlight">visual experiences</span> that connect with people, whether through thoughtful UX design or expressive <span class="highlight">illustration</span>. My goal is to merge <span class="highlight">storytelling</span> with usability, crafting work that feels both intuitive and emotionally resonant.</p>
                            
                            <p>I want to use design as a tool not just for function, but for <span class="highlight">emotional impact</span>. I'm especially interested in projects that blend <span class="highlight">creativity and empathy</span>, where design solves problems, tells stories, and reflects the human experience in subtle, powerful ways.</p>

                        <h3>Empathy</h3>
                        <p>I believe great design begins with deep listening. Whether I'm building a layout or sketching a character, I always try to understand the person on the other end — what they feel, what they need, and what they expect. My process is rooted in human connection, not just visuals.</p>

                    <div class="value-item">
                        <h3>Clarity</h3>
                        <p>I value intentional communication. I aim to remove noise and focus on what truly matters: structure, flow, and message. Whether in UI design or illustration, I avoid visual clutter in favor of meaningful hierarchy, space, and storytelling.</p>

                    <div class="value-item">
                        <h3>Adaptability</h3>
                        <p>Design isn't one-size-fits-all. I adapt quickly to new tools, styles, and feedback. Whether through collaboration or experimentation, I treat every challenge as a chance to learn and evolve while staying grounded in purpose.</p>

                        <p>I want the things I create to feel valuable. Not just in how they look or function, but in how they resonate. Whether it's a digital interface or a single illustration, my goal is to make work that people connect with, reflect on, or carry with them in some way. If someone sees something I've made and feels like it matters, even a little, then I've done what I set out to do.</p>
                        
                        <p>I'm currently seeking <span class="highlight">internship opportunities</span> where I can contribute to real-world projects in <span class="highlight">UX</span>, <span class="highlight">web</span>, or <span class="highlight">visual storytelling</span>. My goal is to apply my skills in a professional setting while continuing to grow as a designer and communicator.</p>

                    <p>Same works for illustration projects, and the amount of assets requested. If it is just a single illustration, it may take 4-10 hours depending on complexity. More illustrations can take up to days.</p>

                    <p>My process includes: discovery and research, concept development, design iterations, client feedback rounds, and final delivery with all necessary files and documentation.</p>
                    <p>The process is quite similar for illustrations, since I want to understand my client's needs before I start sketching. I also like to send the sketch for analysis before I start the lineart.</p>
