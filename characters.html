                    <h3>How he came to life</h3>
                    <p>Hiro was the first character I ever created. He was made way back in 2015, when I was only 8 years old. My best friend at the time, who was coincidentally also called Pedro, had the idea of making a comic, and asked me to design one of the characters for him. That is when Hiro came to life.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since I was a child, I didn't really think too much about it and just did what I thought was cool, which led to nowadays Hiro being COMPLETELY different from the first version. But somehow, I got so attached to that character that I kept it with me, and turned it into one of my OCs. My first OC.</p>
                    
                    <p>The name 'Hiro' was in reference to the character Hiro Hamada from the movie Big Hero 6. And to be honest, I have no idea where the surname 'Mashida' came from. I just thought about a Japanese last name that sounded cool.</p>
                    
                    <p>I kind of based Hiro on me, so his personality matches mine. He's usually quiet and collected, but can be chaotic and talkative around the right people. He knows when to speak, and when to stay silent. Hiro pays tons of attention to the people around him, and is constantly trying to make the day of the ones he love. He likes to draw, listen to music, and birds. Especially owls. His favorite color is purple.</p>

                    <h3>How she came to life</h3>
                    <p>Right after creating Hiro, I decided to create more characters and integrate them to my story that I was writing at the time, and Maya was the second character I came up with. Her name comes from the character May from the Pokémon series. I added an 'a', and made it my character. How original.</p>
                    
                    <p>I made her in the image of my 'perfect girl'. She is everything I would wish for in a romantic interest, and because of that, she is Hiro's romantic interest. This is mainly the reason why she is my comfort character.</p>
                    
                    <p>She's shy and doesn't open easily, but once she gets comfortable with you, she becomes a complete chatterbox. She's very emotional, but mature at the same time. Maya loves reading, spending time with her loved ones, and cats. Her favourite color is yellow.</p>

                    <h3>How she came to life</h3>
                    <p>Part of what inspired me to draw was having my friend around, and since he moved schools, my desire was slowly fading. That was until 2019, when I met my today's best friend who also loves to draw, and my passion came back to life.</p>
                    
                    <p>That was when I felt the need to create more characters and build my story again. Then I made Momoka and Kim.</p>
                    
                    <p>Momoka is one of my extroverted characters. She is chaotic and loud, but everybody loves her for being herself. She is the group's soul, and 'big sister energy'. Her favorite color is red.</p>
                    
                    <p>Even though she is one of my oldest characters, I have very few drawings of her. My art style got better throughout the years, and since it would take me a long time to draw her, I felt the need to redesign her every time from how much my style changed. That's the reason why she looks different in every single drawing. Until this year (2025), when I decided to settle on her design for good.</p>

                    <h3>How he came to life</h3>
                    <p>I always found white/silver hair characters cool. This was the main motivator to create a character with silver hair, and partially the reason why Zeke has been my 'favorite child' recently. He is definitely the character I enjoy drawing the most at the moment.</p>
                    
                    <p>I wanted his last name to have some sort of connection to his hair color. That's when I came up with Tetsu, which means 'iron' in Japanese. I think this last name also fits with the character's personality and vibes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Zeke is the 'class clown', always joking around and making his friends laugh. His personality is lively, and he's always in a good mood. Although he seems like a tough person on the outside, Zeke is actually very soft on the inside, and loves listening to his friend's problems and helping them with it. His favorite color, you guessed it, is white.</p>

                    <h3>How she came to life</h3>
                    <p>Before I made Mila, I noticed I had four male characters and two females. To make it more fair, I decided to create more female characters.</p>
                    
                    <p>When I was a kid, I used to have a huge crush on ginger characters in movies and cartoons, so I made Minerva with this old memory pairing my head. Surprisingly, she is the hardest character to draw in my opinion because of her features (hair, eyes, etc.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Mila's personality is close to Zeke's, in a sense that she is always joking around with the girls and is fierce and lively. Although she is explicitly soft and emotional, in counterpart to him.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since she is one of my most recent characters, I do not have that many drawings of her.</p>
                    
                    <p>Her favorite color is magenta.</p>

                    <p>Ada was the last character I made, in order to make the number of male characters and female characters even.</p>
                    
                    <p>I thought it would fit easily in narratives if I separated my characters by groups. Both groups had the clown (Zeke and Mila), the older sibling (Momoka and Hiro), and the quiet one (Maya and Kyoto). It felt like something was missing in the girls group. They needed their Kim, their golden retriever. So I made Ada.</p>
                    
                    <p>Her favorite color is pink.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm still in the process of developing her as a character, so she's not just 'Kim's female counterpart'. This is also the reason why she only has a few drawings.</p>

                    <h3>How he came to life</h3>
                    <p>Tyson was kind of an accident. I was drawing one of my favorite artists, Yeonjun from TOMORROW X TOGETHER, but halfway through the drawing I realized it looked nothing like him. And even so, I loved the drawing and thought about making him an OC too.</p>
                    
                    <p>I made some adjustments here and there and took some other inspirations, and Tyson came to life.</p>
                    
                    <p>I was still learning how to draw when I made him, so in the beginning it was kind of hard to make him not look like Hiro, because many of their features are similar. Eventually, I could come up with original designs for both and I'm proud of this process of redescovering my art style.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tyson's favorite color is orange.</p>

                    <h3>How she came to life</h3>
                    <p>Just like Tyson, Hilda was a complete accident. In grade 11, we had to make a drawing with eight characters in my arts class. At the moment I only had seven, so I had to create a character on the spot. I loved her design so much that I turned her into an OC.</p>
                    
                    <p>It was also kind of a coincidence. I wanted a Brazilian character since it's where I'm from, and Hilda traits were similar. She wasn't named yet, so giving her a Brazilian name and adjusting some parts of her design would make it work just fine. And for this reason, she is one of my most biased characters currently.</p>
                    
                    <p>Hilda is the group's athlete. She's a volleyball player, and very active in general. She's also the representation of my culture, someone bright and happy, that knows when to be strict or take things seriously. She also loves partying. Her favorite color is blue.</p>
